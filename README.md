# Machine Learning with Python

Material and notebooks from the machine learning course. 

The jupyter notebooks are in the directories [Regression](Regression/)  , [Classification](Classfication), [Clustering](Clustering/) and [Recommendation](RecommendationSys/). The content of each Folder is listed below in a schematic way. 

The [Data](Data/) directory contains a bunch of .csv and other auxiliary files used in the notebooks. All such files should be generated/downloaded running the notebooks. In principle, you should never need to access the files in this directory, but they're here just in case..

The [FinalAssignmentNotebook](Final ML Assignment.ipynb/) contains a final example of classification applied to the predicion of Loan Payments.
